        <h3>Origin & History</h3>
        <p>
            The humble carrot was first domesticated in Persia (modern Iran and Afghanistan) over a thousand years ago. The earliest cultivated carrots were actually purple and yellow! Orange carrots‚Äîwhat most people picture today‚Äîbecame popular in the 17th century in the Netherlands, possibly to honor the Dutch Royal Family (‚ÄúHouse of Orange‚Äù).

        <h3>How to Grow Carrots (with Geoff‚Äôs Tips!)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Sow outdoors</b> as soon as the soil can be worked, about 3 weeks before last frost.</li>
            <li><b>Soil must be loose</b>, sandy, and well-draining‚Äîrocks will cause the roots to fork and split!</li>
            <li><b>Plant seeds shallowly</b>, 1/4 inch deep. Thin seedlings to allow room for roots to grow thick and straight.</li>
            <li><b>Keep the soil moist</b> until seeds germinate (up to 14 days).</li>
            <li>Harvest most varieties in 70-85 days. Pull carefully, using a fork if the ground is hard.</li>
        </ol>

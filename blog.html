        <h3>🌱 The Carrot & The Worm: Lessons in Friendship</h3>
        <p><em>Posted by Geoff, June 2024</em></p>
        <p>
            Deep in the garden, I met a curious worm named Walter. At first, I worried he'd eat too much of my home! But we soon became pals. I learned worms keep the soil soft and healthy, so carrots like me can grow strong and tall. Moral: We all have a job, and working together makes everything better!

        <p>
            Did you know carrots come in so many colors? This month, I hosted the first annual Rainbow Carrot Parade! From purple to yellow, each root told a unique story. We even had a “Most Unusual Shape” competition. Fun fact: odd-shaped carrots taste just as great!

            My canine friend Buster thinks carrots are his favorite treat! Carrots are safe for dogs (in moderation), crunchy, low calorie, and good for their teeth. Buster gets a carrot after every walk!

        <h3>👨‍🌾 Easy Science: Grow Your Own Carrot Tops!</h3>
        <p>
            Try this at home: Cut the top inch off a carrot, set it in a shallow dish with water (cut side down), and place near a sunny window. Change the water every day. Watch for new green shoots! You can’t grow a whole new root, but you’ll have beautiful greens to eat or decorate with.
